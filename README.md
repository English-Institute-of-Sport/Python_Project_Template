> Write a brief description of your project. You can optionally provide details on how it came about, inspiration, reading, current usage (try keep it short - or link it to any further documentation on the project).

\<Project Title> is a <repository/tool/solution> that allows \<audience> to do \<action>.

The inspiration for this project came from <paper/article/blog>. It currently does <action + detail> and is used by <audience + detail>. This project is <in development/production or depreciated>.

## Prerequisites

> Write information about relevant operating, infrastructure and knowledge pre-requisites. At the least, detail what operating system you have used and tested the solution on, which programming languages or frameworks are used, and what areas of knowledge someone may need to understand your project E.g.

Before you begin, make sure you can meet the following requirements:

+ You have a machine with: **Windows 10** or later, **Ubuntu 18.04** or later, or **MacOS 10.13** or later.
+ You have basic understanding of **Python** and **Juptyer Notebooks**.
+ If you are installing this project **locally** (e.g. not in Deepnote), you have a way of creating a **virtual environment**. We recommend installing and using [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (and CMD Prompt if on Windows).
+ You have read the relevant **documentation** for this project.

## Installing

> Write instructions here for installing and/or running the solution. E.g. provide actionable code snippets for installing project dependencies (packages the project will depend on or need to run).

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/English-Institute-of-Sport/Python_Project_Template.git my_new_project
$ cd my_new_project
# Create and activate virtual env (e.g. conda)
$ conda create --name my_new_project python=3.9
$ conda activate my_new_project
# Install project dependencies from requirements.txt
$ (my_new_project) pip install -r requirements.txt
# Deactivate virtual env (e.g. conda)
$ (my_new_project) conda deactivate
```

## Running

> Write instructions for using your solution or running your project. E.g. providing actionable code snippets for running the main script or providing details on how to interact with an interactive notebook.

```python
$ cd my_new_project
$ conda activate my_new_project
# Open Jupyter with your solution of choice e.g. jupyter notebook
$ (my_new_project) jupyter notebook
```

## Contributing

> Your guidelines for someone else contributing to your project. E.g. see [contributing.md](./contributing.md).

## Contact

> Provide additional information for contacting the main contributors (if necessary).
